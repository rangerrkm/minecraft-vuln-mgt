# Minecraft Network Defense
Educational 2-4 player minecraft scenario focusing on vulnerability management - identification, prioritization, triage. At the end of each round players can be scored on performance.

Defend your network against cyber threats in a multiplayer Minecraft scenario. Build a firewall to keep attackers out of a defensive perimeter. Use cyber defense tools to stop the bad guys, and go hunting for cyber threat intelligence. But watch out, sophisticated attackers might already be inside your network!
